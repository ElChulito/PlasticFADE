# Model_FRAG-DEGR
*(Research in progress)*    

This project involves the development of a model for plastic fragmentation and degradation in the environment. The model can calculating fragmentation and degradation rates specific to polymers and compartments. The project contributes to the development of the MarILCA methodology (www.marilca.org).
