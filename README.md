# PlasticFADE
*(First version available)*    

This project involves the development of a model for plastic fragmentation and degradation in the environment. The model can be used to compute fragmentation and degradation rate constants of a given polymer in a specific compartment. The model currently covers seven polymers (PP, PS, EPS, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PE) and seven compartments (air, topsoil, subsoil, beach, water surface, water column, sediment). The project contributes to the implementation of the MarILCA (Marine Impacts in LCA) modeling framework (www.marilca.org).
