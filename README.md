# PlasticFADE
*(Research in progress)*    

This project involves the development of a model for plastic fragmentation and degradation in the environment. The model can calculate fragmentation and degradation rates specific to a given polymer in a specific compartment. The project contributes to the implementation of the MarILCA (Marine Impacts in LCA) modeling framework (www.marilca.org).
